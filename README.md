# BC2402-Designing-Developing-Databases

In this project, we designed and implemented relational and non-relational databases to analyse
three different Covid-19 datasets, namely “country_vaccinations”,
“country_vaccinations_by_manufacturer” and “covid19data” respectively. These databases are
organized collections of information, and data pertaining to Covid-19, where we can perform
structured and non-structured queries to obtain these data and conduct analyses to better
understand the data. This allowed us to better measure the vaccination driver and its
effectiveness by tracking the vaccination and the number of covid cases in the respective
countries.
